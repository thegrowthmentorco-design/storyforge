/* M0.1.3 — smoke specs for the public unauth surfaces.
 *
 * What we cover:
 *   1. /sign-in renders without crashing (Clerk's <SignIn /> mounts).
 *   2. /share/<bogus-token> renders the "not found" state cleanly.
 *
 * What we DON'T cover (yet):
 *   - Upload → extract → see structured artifacts. Needs Clerk auth bypass
 *     in the backend (STORYFORGE_E2E_USER_ID dep override). Tracked as
 *     M0.1.3.b in PROJECT.md.
 *
 * If either spec goes red, the SPA can't even boot — the auth + share
 * routes are critical entry points.
